# Find_Ones_In_Binary_Number

Given a base-10 integer, n, first method converts it to binary (base-2). 
The second method finds the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation. 

Example
The binary representation of n = 125 is 0111 1101. 
There are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. 
The method finds the maximum, which is 5.
